# Field Scout

Sending input pictures/files

To be run on an edge device on the field, which takes pictures (or generates files) every x seconds separately and saves them into a directory on-device. Our program watches the directory and sends to object storage when needed. Our program will also delete all sent images after a certain amount of time.
